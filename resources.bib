However, current scat survey methods are problematic due to lack of either accuracy or feasibility, i.e. they are either biased or very time-consuming in the field. This study aimed to establish a new koala scat survey method with improved accuracy compared with existing methods, and practical in the field. We developed a new Balanced Koala Scat Survey method (BKSS), and evaluated it in the field by analysing scat detectability variations and comparing it with a current survey method, the Spot Assessment Technique (SAT), to determine scat searching accuracy. The results revealed that current methods were biased by assigning consistent searching effort for all trees, because effective searching time to detect the first scat was significantly affected by Koala Activity Level (KAL-the proportion of trees found with scats among all 30 trees in a survey site). Compared with BKSS, SAT tended to yield more false negative outcomes; SAT may miss up to 46{\%} of trees with scats when KAL was low. The application of BKSS is expected to greatly enhance the reliability of koala scat surveys in determining koala distribution and thus improve their conservation management.},

Closer examination of their ecological history suggests that frequent mild burning by Aborigines maintained eucalypt forests having fewer, mostly healthy trees, fewer young trees, canopies comprising mostly hard and dry leaves with low nutrient content, and, consequently, very few koalas. European explorers did not see them because they were solitary animals occupying large home ranges. After burning was disrupted, koalas responded to increased food resources in dense new growth of eucalypts and in stressed trees continually turning over new foliage. An export skin industry ﬂourished. When their food resources were depleted by clearing or ringbarking of new growth and/or death of declining stands during droughts, koalas crashed back to low levels. Koalas continue to irrupt and decline through much of their range according to changing land management. Wildlife managers should re-assess their status and their management from a clear historical and ecological perspective.},

  abstract = {Context: At some sites in southern Victoria, browsing pressure caused by high-density koala populations can result in defoliation of preferred browse trees. In extreme cases, this over-browsing can lead to widespread tree death and starvation of koalas. To reduce the potential for mortality of trees and koalas, a management strategy that includes fertility control of females and translocation of healthy individuals (male and female) has been adopted. Aims: To compare the short- to medium-term survival and body condition of koalas translocated from over-browsed habitat and released into unoccupied (or nearly so) habitat with that of koalas left in situ in compromised habitat. Methods: We monitored survival and body condition of 36 translocated koalas for 4-5 months after translocation relative to that of a control group (24 animals) left in situ. Koalas were recaptured and body condition measured (as a scaled body-mass index) ∼40 and 137 days after translocation. Additionally, GPS loggers were used to investigate patterns of koala movement. Key results: Survival rates of translocated koalas were not different from those of controls and females in both groups showed slightly higher survival rates than did males. After 137 days, control animals had lower scaled body mass, whereas translocated animals, after an initial reduction, had mostly regained, or increased their scaled body mass. Translocated females regained their original scaled body mass faster than did translocated males. Male koalas in both control and translocated groups had higher rates of movement than did females, and translocated koalas had slightly higher rates of movement than did control koalas. Translocated koalas moved farther from their release location than control koalas. Conclusions: On the basis of the scaled body-mass index, translocated koalas fared better than those left in situ in compromised habitat, even though the density of koalas in the over-browsed habitat had been reduced by a wider salvage translocation program. The process used to identify potential release sites, including a spatial koala-habitat index, accurately predicted suitable koala habitat. Implications: The current management strategy of translocating koalas out of over-browsed habitat is supported and could be more widely applied.},

In many areas koala populations are under threat, in particular from the direct and indirect effects of ongoing habitat destruction due to increased urbanisation and other anthropogenic processes. Climate change presents additional threats to the integrity of koala habitats because many species of food and non-food trees have narrow climate envelopes and are unable to adapt to altered temperatures and rainfall. Climate extremes also produce physiological stresses in koalas that may increase the likelihood of outbreaks of chlamydiosis and other diseases. Climate change–related increases in the relative content of toxic chemicals in leaves are further stresses to the koala after ingestion. In addition, populations that originated from a small number of founder individuals are at potential risk due to their relatively low genetic diversity. Strategies that maintain residual habitat fragments and promote the construction of new refugia are now being formulated. Modelling of the impact of habitat metrics on koala distribution is providing important information that can be used in the rehabilitation of koala refugia. In future these models could be augmented with metrics that describe koala homeostasis to inform local conservation strategies. These considerations are also relevant for the maintenance of other taxa in the wider ecosystem that are also at risk from habitat destruction and climate change.},

  abstract        = {An understanding of the threats to threatened species in urban and peri-urban areas is essential to develop successful management approaches. Dog attacks are considered to be a major contributor to koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) mortalities in peri-urban areas of north-eastern Australia. Predation could be due to either domestic dogs or wild dogs (dingoes and dingo-domestic dog hybrids), gentically-identifiable groups of Canis familiaris. Here, we aimed to use genetic sampling methods to determine or verify the identity, number and successful removal of canid predators of koalas in a peri-urban environment in south-eastern Queensland. Genetic samples were taken from the remains of 12 koalas suspected to have died from predation. Canine genotypes were present on 11 of 12 predated koalas (∼92{\%}) and were from wild dogs, not domestic dogs. Most koalas had only one canine genotype identified, suggesting they were killed by a single dog. Our results show that DNA samples collected from deceased prey species can be used to identify the predator, and distinguish between closely-related species, and hybrids of the two. Genetic methods confirmed the identification of the predator obtained through conventional necropsy and support growing evidence that wild dog predation is a significant cause of koala mortality in this region. Strategies to reduce predation on koalas should therefore focus on reducing the impact of free-ranging wild dog populations. This approach is important to identify and target those canids responsible for predation of threatened prey populations, particularly where multiple predators are present and/or predator removals may be controversial.},

  abstract  = {Imperfect detection can bias estimates of site occupancy in ecological surveys but can be corrected by estimating detection probability. Time-to-first-detection (TTD) occupancy models have been proposed as a cost–effective survey method that allows detection probability to be estimated from single site visits. Nevertheless, few studies have validated the performance of occupancy-detection models by creating a situation where occupancy is known, and model outputs can be compared with the truth. We tested the performance of TTD occupancy models in the face of detection heterogeneity using an experiment based on standard survey methods to monitor koala Phascolarctos cinereus populations in Australia. Known numbers of koala faecal pellets were placed under trees, and observers, uninformed as to which trees had pellets under them, carried out a TTD survey. We fitted five TTD occupancy models to the survey data, each making different assumptions about detectability, to evaluate how well each estimated the true occupancy status. Relative to the truth, all five models produced strongly biased estimates, overestimating detection probability and underestimating the number of occupied trees. Despite this, goodness-of-fit tests indicated that some models fitted the data well, with no evidence of model misfit. Hence, TTD occupancy models that appear to perform well with respect to the available data may be performing poorly. The reason for poor model performance was unaccounted for heterogeneity in detection probability, which is known to bias occupancy-detection models. This poses a problem because unaccounted for heterogeneity could not be detected using goodness-of-fit tests and was only revealed because we knew the experimentally determined outcome. A challenge for occupancy-detection models is to find ways to identify and mitigate the impacts of unobserved heterogeneity, which could unknowingly bias many models.},

Reporting of wildlife sightings by members of the public provides an opportunity to collect wildlife data continuously over wider geographical areas, at lower cost. We used individual koala sightings reported by members of the public between 1997 and 2013 in South-East Queensland, Australia (n = 14,076 koala sightings) to describe spatial and temporal trends in koala presence, to estimate koala sighting density and to identify biases associated with sightings. Temporal trends in sightings mirrored the breeding season of koalas. Sightings were high in residential areas (63{\%}), followed by agricultural (15{\%}), and parkland (12{\%}). The study area was divided into 57,780 one-square kilometer grid cells and grid cells with no sightings of koalas decreased over time (from 35{\%} to 21{\%}) indicative of a greater level of spatial overlap of koala home ranges and human activity areas over time. The density of reported koala sightings decreased as distance from primary and secondary roads increased, indicative of a higher search effort near roads. Our results show that koala sighting data can be used to refine koala distribution and population estimates derived from active surveying, on the condition that appropriate bias correction techniques are applied. Collecting koala absence and search effort information and conducting repeated searches for koalas in the same areas are useful approaches to improve the quality of sighting data in citizen science programs.},

  abstract        = {Context. Mammal populations around the world are increasingly threatened with population fragmentation because of loss of habitat or barriers to gene flow. The investigation of koala populations in the Sydney region not only provides valuable information about this vulnerable species, but also serves as a model for other species that have suffered major rapid declines in population size, and are now recovering in fragmented habitat. The peri-urban study region allows investigation of the impact of landscape features such as major roads and housing developments on koala gene flow. Aims. Animals originating from four geographic sampling areas around Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, were examined to determine population structure and gene flow and to identify barriers to gene flow and management units. Methods. The present study examined 12 microsatellite loci and used Bayesian assignment methods and genic frequency analysis methods to identify demographically separate populations and barriers to gene flow between those populations. Key results. Three discrete populations were resolved, with all displaying moderate to high levels of genetic differentiation among them ($\theta$0.141-0.224). The allelic richness and heterozygosity of the Blue Mountains population (A=6.46, HO=0.66) is comparable to the highest diversity found in any koala population previously investigated. However, considerably lower genetic diversity was found in the Campbelltown population (A=3.17, HO=0.49), which also displayed evidence of a recent population bottleneck (effective population size estimated at 1621). Conclusions. Animals separated by a military reserve were identified as one population, suggesting that the reserve maintains gene flow within this population. By contrast, strong differentiation of two geographically close populations separated by several potential barriers to gene flow suggested these land-use features pose barriers to gene flow. Implications. Implications of these findings for management of koala populations in the Greater Sydney region are discussed. In particular, the need to carefully consider the future of a military reserve is highlighted, along with possible solutions to allow gene flow across the proposed barrier regions. Because these are demographically separate populations, specific management plans tailored to the needs of each population will need to be formulated. {\textcopyright} 2010 CSIRO.},

  abstract        = {Establishing species distribution and population trends are basic requirements in conservation biology, yet acquiring this fundamental information is often difficult. Indirect survey methods that rely on fecal pellets (scats) can overcome some difficulties but present their own challenges. In particular, variation in scat detectability and decay rate can introduce biases. We studied how vegetation communities affect the detectability and decay rate of scats as exemplified by koalas Phascolarctos cinereus: scat detectability was highly and consistently dependent on ground layer complexity (introducing up to 16 non-detection bias); scat decay rates were highly heterogeneous within vegetation communities; exposure of scats to surface water and rain strongly accelerated scat decay rate and finally, invertebrates were found to accelerate scat decay rate markedly, but unpredictably. This last phenomenon may explain the high variability of scat decay rate within a single vegetation community. Methods to decrease biases should be evaluated when planning scat surveys, as the most appropriate method(s) will vary depending on species, scale of survey and landscape characteristics. Detectability and decay biases are both stronger in certain vegetation communities, thus their combined effect is likely to introduce substantial errors in scat surveys and this could result in inappropriate and counterproductive management decisions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Romane H.

  abstract        = {Traditional sensitivity and elasticity analyses of matrix population models have been used to inform management decisions, but they ignore the economic costs of manipulating vital rates. For example, the growth rate of a population is often most sensitive to changes in adult survival rate, but this does not mean that increasing that rate is the best option for managing the population because it may be much more expensive than other options. To explore how managers should optimize their manipulation of vital rates, we incorporated the cost of changing those rates into matrix population models. We derived analytic expressions for locations in parameter space where managers should shift between management of fecundity and survival, for the balance between fecundity and survival management at those boundaries, and for the allocation of management resources to sustain that optimal balance. For simple matrices, the optimal budget allocation can often be expressed as simple functions of vital rates and the relative costs of changing them. We applied our method to management of the Helmeted Honeyeater (Lichenostomus melanops cassidix; an endangered Australian bird) and the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) as examples. Our method showed that cost-efficient management of the Helmeted Honeyeater should focus on increasing fecundity via nest protection, whereas optimal koala management should focus on manipulating both fecundity and survival simultaneously. These findings are contrary to the cost-negligent recommendations of elasticity analysis, which would suggest focusing on managing survival in both cases. A further investigation of Helmeted Honeyeater management options, based on an individual-based model incorporating density dependence, spatial structure, and environmental stochasticity, confirmed that fecundity management was the most cost-effective strategy. Our results demonstrate that decisions that ignore economic factors will reduce management efficiency.},

Confidence intervals associated with Koala activity data from 405 randomly selected field plots within which faecal pellets were recorded have been utilised to assign threshold values for three population density/habitat biomes in eastern Australia.
